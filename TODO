* Mustache.js parses sections before it parses partials. Since Selleck's heading
  sections rely on order of execution to determine position and nesting, this
  means that heading sections in partials always come at the end of the table of
  contents, regardless of the partial's document position. Need to figure out a
  workaround.

* Mustache.js strips a trailing space (after the {{/close}} tag) when replacing 
  a section with its content. This is okay for blocks, but not cool for inline
  sections. Workaround needed.
